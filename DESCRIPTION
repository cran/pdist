Description: Computes the euclidean distance between rows of a matrix X
        and rows of another matrix Y.  Previously, this could be done
        by binding the two matrices together and calling 'dist', but
        this creates unnecessary computation by computing the distances
        between a row of X and another row of X, and likewise for Y.
        pdist strictly computes distances across the two matrices, not
        within the same matrix, making computations significantly
        faster for certain use cases.
